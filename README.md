# Amazon Reviwes Using PySpark

The main goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast the rating given to a review on Amazon, solely based on the textual content of the review. By leveraging the available data from Amazon's "CDs and vinyl" database, the project aims to train a machine learning model capable of learning the underlying patterns and associations between the content of the reviews and the corresponding ratings assigned by the reviewers.  
Once the model is trained on this dataset, it can be deployed to predict the ratings for new, unseen reviews by analyzing the textual information provided in those reviews. The ultimate objective is to provide a reliable tool that can automatically predict the ratings of Amazon reviews, aiding in understanding customer sentiments and enhancing the decision-making process for potential buyers. In this project we used two models: Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
